#RNN Model with Embedding Layer

##Overview
An RNN model with an embedding layer converts word indices into dense vectors, capturing semantics. The RNN processes these, maintaining hidden states. Dense layers predict outcomes, which is useful for text classification.

##Key Features
###Embedding Layer: Transforms word indices into dense vectors, reducing input dimensionality and capturing semantic relationships.

###RNN Layer: Processes the embedded sequences step-by-step, maintaining hidden states to capture context.

###Dense Layers: Uses the final hidden states to predict outcomes effectively.

##Applications
1. This model is particularly useful for:

2. Text classification tasks

3. Sentiment analysis

4. Sequential data processing

How It Works
###Input: Sequences of word indices.

###Embedding: Converts indices to dense vectors.

###RNN Processing: Maintains hidden states while processing sequences.

###Prediction: Dense layers predict the final outcomes.
